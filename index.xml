      <description>I am pleased to announce that investr, my very first R package, has now been on CRAN for four years! investr, which is short for inverse estimation in R and has nothing to do with investing, contains functions that facilitate inverse estimation (e.g., statistical calibration) in linear, generalized linear, nonlinear, and (linear) mixed-effects models. A generic function, plotFit, is also provided for plotting fitted regression models with or without confidence/prediction bands that may be of use to the general user.</description>
